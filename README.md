# Climate Change Misinformation Detection

This project was to detect "Climate Change Misinformation" given a dataset consisting on only misinformation. In this task, several reputed news websites were scraped in order to obtain a dataset consisting of 'true climate change information'. Hence a binary classifier was built using the provided misinformation and the scraped true information on climate change. 

Several models were used in this task which included: simple machine learning models (Logistic regression and SVM), Feed Forward Neural Networks and LSTMs.
